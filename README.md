# Description

The Pet Classification Challenge involves classifying images of cats and dogs using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of 1000 images each of cats and dogs, represented as 64x64 grayscale images. The main task is to implement classifiers, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Nearest Neighbor (NN), to distinguish between the two classes.

The project uses dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space and improve model performance. Error rates are computed for each classifier, with QDA and NN achieving the lowest error rates of 0.043. The classifiers are evaluated using cross-validation to prevent overfitting, and optimal hyperparameters are selected for each algorithm.

The project provides valuable insights into image classification techniques and demonstrates the importance of selecting the right model and feature space for optimal performance.
